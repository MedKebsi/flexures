This tutorial assumes you desire to optimize an object 
for which you have to analyse the full domain 
AND symmetry of the resulting topology is not expected 
(due to asymmetric loading scenarios)


1. Open COMSOL Multiphysics
2. Choose Model Wizard
3. Select Space Dimension -> (2D or 3D)

From here on we denote the dimension by DIM.

4. Select Physics -> Solid Mechanics (solid) -> Add -> Study
5. Select Study -> Optimization -> Topology Optimization, Stationary -> Done

Now you have generated an empty DIM model.

6. Build your geometry.

E.g. right-click on Geometry 1 -> Square (Build All Objects to visualize your Geometry)

7. Generate your Material. Right-click on Materials -> Blank Material

Material 1 (mat1):
Set e.g. E = 1 [Pa], nu = 0.3, rho = 1 kg/m3, or use 

Alternatively, you can use a "real" material.

8. Go to Component 1 -> Materials -> Topology Link 1
Set Material: your material, and Density Model1 (dtopo1)

9. Define your loadcases.

Add one Solid Mechanics module per loadcase. (Right-click Solid Mechanics (solid) 
-> Copy, Right-click Component 1 (comp1) -> Paste Solid Mechanics for a new module)
E.g. if you want you domain to be stiff in tension, 
but compliant in shear, you will have 2 loadcases and thus 2 Solid Mechanics modules.

for (loadcase) {

Set Fixed Constraint.
Set Prescribed Displacement (make sure to check all the boxes u0x, u0y etc. 
and set displacements as desired).
The combination of the latter should represent 
the "deformation pattern" or "mode" of this loadcase, 
e.g. the desired/undesired movement of the object.

}

10. Go to Study 1 -> Topology Optimization

Setting up to objective function:
Your objective function consists of ALL strain energies 
of prescribed deformation patterns you require to be STIFF
Set e.g. 
comp1.solid.Ws_tot
Comp1.solid2.Ws_tot

Type: Maximization
Solution ("Auto" if single, "Sum of objectives" if multiple)

Add constraints:
Your constraint function consist of ALL strain energies 
of prescribed deformation patterns you required to be COMPLIANT
Set e.g.
comp1.solid3.Ws_tot (upper bound 10)
comp1.solid4.Ws_tot (upper bound 20)
The upper bound obviously are derived from your application 
(that is the maximum stored energy/stiffness for this prescribed displacement)

11. Output while solving -> Plot -> 
Output material volume fraction (requires at least 1 run)

12. Post proc (see COMSOL tutorials)

Enjoy your output!

One love,

Stijn
